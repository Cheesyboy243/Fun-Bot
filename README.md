# Fun-Bot

This is just a bot with some fun games in it using discord-gamecord
You will need to install the following

- discord.js
- @discordjs/rest
- discord-gamecord
- dotenv

Once these are installed the bot should work. Be sure to fill out the information need in the .env file

also there are some deprecations with the commands. Dont worry about those, the commands still work fine and you shouldnt have a problem with it
